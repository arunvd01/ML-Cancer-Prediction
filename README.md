# 🧬 Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the presence of cancer based on patient data. It is implemented in Python using various data preprocessing and classification algorithms to deliver accurate and efficient predictions.

## 📂 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load and preprocess a cancer dataset.
- Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Train machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different classifiers.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
- **Attributes**: 30 features (mean, standard error, and worst values of real-valued features such as radius, texture, etc.)
- **Target**: Diagnosis (Malignant or Benign)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧪 Models Applied

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC Curve

## 📌 Key Highlights

- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Correlation heatmaps for feature analysis
- Grid Search and Cross Validation for hyperparameter tuning
- Model comparison for best performance

## 🖼 Sample Results

- Random Forest gave the highest accuracy among the models.
- ROC AUC analysis showed improved performance with ensemble methods.
